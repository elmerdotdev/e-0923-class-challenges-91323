/**
 * Create a program to find the circumference of a circle using diameter
 * 
 * Pseudocode:
 * 1. Input diameter (dtr)
 * 2. Calculate circumference by multiplying the diameter with the value of PI
 * 3. Print circumference (cmf)
 * 
 * Note: Create a constant for the value of PI and use that constant name on the formula (i.e. const PI = 3.14)
 * 
 * Number of lines expected: 4
